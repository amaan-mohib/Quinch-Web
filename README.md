# Quinch Web

A quiz app made with React.js and Firebase.

### Help

There are 10 questions throughout the quiz.
Each question carries 10 points, so a total of 100 points can be scored.

For help there are four lifelines unlocked at certain levels of the
quiz, with an increase in the allotted time of +10 seconds at those
levels.
But, every lifeline can be used only once with a deduction of 5 points.
